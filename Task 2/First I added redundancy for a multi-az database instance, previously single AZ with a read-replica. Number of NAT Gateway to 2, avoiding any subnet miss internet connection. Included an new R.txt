Redundancy for multi-az database master instance.
Added a new NAT Gateway to have 2 (redundancy)
Included a new RDS Replica in another region (IRELAND)
Included an CDN in front of the S3 bucket to provide data close to users
Included an Amazon Elasticache for fast access 
In a s3 bucket, we could add a lifecycle policy to avoid unnecessary costs for infraquently access (old files)
