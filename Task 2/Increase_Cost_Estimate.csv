I have included to improve performance:
Redundancy for multi-az database master instance. Previously It was single-az instance with a read replica
Added a new NAT Gateway to have 2 (redundancy)
Included a new RDS Replica in another Region in order to protect againt disasters the data
Included an CDN in front of the S3 bucket to provide data close to users
Included an Amazon Elasticache for fast access 
In a s3 bucket, we could add a lifecycle policy to avoid unnecessary costs for infraquently access (old files)
